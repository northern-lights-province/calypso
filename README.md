# CALYPSO: LLMs as Dungeon Masters’ Assistants

This repository contains the main CALYPSO system from the paper [*CALYPSO: LLMs as Dungeon Masters’
Assistants*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07540). CALYPSO takes the form of a Discord bot that DMs can use to understand
D&D monsters and brainstorm encounter ideas.

**This repository is a working version of CALYPSO under active use and development** for the Northern Lights Province
Discord server. For a copy of the CALYPSO system presented in the paper that is capable of running standalone, see
